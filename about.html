        <h1>WHO ARE WE?</h1>
           <p>My name is Angela Deng, a Western studdents majoring in Software Engineering. To put it simply, programming is difficult. It can be difficult to master, and overwhelming to begin to learn. There are so many resources with an abudance of information, it can make it incredibly intimidating to begin learning. Lilypad Coding aims to simplify and streamline the learning process by making the topic approachable with less technical terms, and more interactive elements to stimulate learning.</p>
